Project Name: Nutrition and Diet Planning System
Overview
A smart application designed to help users create personalized diet plans based on their health conditions, dietary preferences, and nutritional requirements. The system leverages knowledge-based AI techniques using the CommonKADS methodology, Python 3.x, and PyQt6 for the graphical user interface.

Core Functionalities
User Profiling

Collects personal details (age, gender, weight, height, activity level).

Records medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension).

Stores dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, low-carb, gluten-free).

Nutritional Analysis

Calculates Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).

Evaluates userâ€™s daily nutrient requirements.

Detects deficiencies and excess intake risks.

Meal Planning & Recommendation

Uses an inference engine to recommend meals.

Considers food preferences, health conditions, and nutritional balance.

Adapts plans based on constraints like allergies or dietary restrictions.

Knowledge-Based Decision Making

Stores food nutritional data in JSON format.

Applies forward-chaining inference for recommendations.

Resolves conflicts between competing diet rules.

Interactive GUI (PyQt6)

Allows users to input data through forms.

Displays meal plans with visual breakdowns.

Supports interactive reports and meal adjustments.

System Architecture
Frontend (GUI)

Developed with PyQt6.

Components:

User Profile Form

Meal Plan Display

Report Generator

Interactive Food Selection

Backend

Uses Python 3.x for logic processing.

JSON-based databases for storing food and user data.

Custom Inference Engine to apply dietary rules.

Core Modules

Profile Manager: Handles user data.

Nutrition Calculator: Computes calorie needs and nutrient intake.

Food Database Interface: Provides nutritional data for meal planning.
